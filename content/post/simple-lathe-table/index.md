 First project in the new workshop. Simply table made from scrap 60 x 60 box sections. After all painted as orange. Table was fitted for my mini lathe. As table surface i used chipboard from old table. Enjoy the photos.

 Table and lathe is quite rigid. In the next posts I'll show lathe mounted on the table.
